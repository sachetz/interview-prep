## Question

Design a data structure to implement N stacks using a single array of size S.

It should support the following operations:
1. push(X, M): Pushes an element X into the Mth stack. Returns true if the element is pushed into the stack, otherwise false.
2. pop(M): Pops the top element from Mth Stack. Returns -1 if the stack is empty, otherwise, returns the popped element.

Constraints:
- 1 <= N <= S <= 1000
- 1 <= X <= 10^5
